"Glass formed by rolling molten glass into a plate, that is sub-sequently ground and polished after cooling. It provides virtually clear, undistorted vision.",Plate Glass
"Glass that has a thin layer of metallic or metallic oxide coating that reduces heat gain and glare from the outside while allowing visible light to enter. It gives the appearance of a one-way mirror, preventing visibility from the outside and thus preventing privacy.",Reflective Glass
"Glass that has a microscopically thin, transparent coating that reflects long-wave infrared energy (or heat). Its coating minimizes the amount of ultraviolet and infrared light that can pass through glass without compromising the amount of visible light that is transmitted.",Low-Emissivity Glass
Glass having one or both sides acid-etched or sandblasted to obscure vision.,Obscure Glass
"A type of safety glass that consists of two or more panes of flat glass bonded together by a layer of polyvinyl butyral resin (PVB). The PVB is the interlayer that holds the glass layers together, even when the glass breaks or impacted by a great force.",Laminated Glass

A glass unit that consists of two panes of glass separated by an inert gas such as argon and krypton to provide thermal insulation and restrict condensation.,Insulating Glass
"Glass that is cooled slowly to relieve internal stresses introduced during the manufacturing process. If it breaks, it results in long, sharp, jagged shards.",Annealed Glass
